## Notepad++ for Configuration Files:
While you can use any text editor to work with the configuration files, it is worth noting that using Notepad++ can greatly enhance your editing experience.

Notepad++ is a popular text editor that provides several useful features, including syntax highlighting. Syntax highlighting helps in visually distinguishing different elements in the configuration files, making them easier to read and understand.

By using Notepad++, you can take advantage of its enhanced functionality and improved readability when working with the configuration files.

If you are unfamiliar with .ini files or find them challenging to read and edit, using Notepad++ can be particularly beneficial. Notepad++ simplifies the process by highlighting important sections, keywords, and values, making it easier to navigate and modify the configuration files.
